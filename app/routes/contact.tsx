                    I created this website using Remix.JS, React.JS, and Tailwind CSS, and deployed it to Cloudflare Pages. I used Sanity.io as the headless CMS provider to power the dynamic content on the site. The design of the website was inspired by flat and neo-brutalist designs, such as Gumroad and Notion, and was created using Figma. If you're interested in working on a project together or getting to know me better, don't hesitate to reach out to me through social media!.<br/>
